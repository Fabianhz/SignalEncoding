The purpose of this program is to encode any digital data into digital signals. The coding schemes implemented in this program are: Nonretun to Zero-Level 
(NRZ-L), Nonreturn to Zero Inverted (NRZ-I), Multilevel Binary Bipolar-AMI, Manchester,and Differential Macnhester. 

NRZ-L and NRZ-I are somewhat similar to unipolar NRZ scheme but here we use two levels of amplitude (voltages). For NRZ-L(NRZ-Level), the level of the voltage 
determines the encoded bit, typically binary 1 maps to negative voltage, and binary 0 maps to high voltage, and for NRZ-I(NRZ-Invert), two-level signal has
a transition at a boundary if the next bit that we are going to transmit is a logical 1, and does not have a transition if the next bit that we are going to transmit
is a logical 0.
Bipolar AMI has three voltage levels: negative, zero, and positive. If the starting input bit is 1 then the output signal can start at negative or positive, if its a zero then it 
will have a zero voltage. After, every time the input bit is 1 then there will be a transition of voltage levels from either negative to positive or positive to negative 
based on the previous 1 bit transition. For example, the the last input was 1 and it output negative, the next input 1 will be positive. If the input is 0 then it will 
be zero regardless.

Manchester encoding is somewhat combination of the RZ (transition at the middle of the bit) and NRZ-L schemes. The duration of the bit is divided into two halves. 
The voltage remains at one level during the first half and moves to the other level in the second half. The transition at the middle of the bit provides synchronization.
When the input bit is a 1 then the voltage levels will shift to negative voltage then transition at the center to positive voltage. Simarly, when the input is zero then the 
the encoded signal will start at positive voltage then transition in the middle to negative voltage. Like the Manchester encoding, the differential Manchester encoded signals have transitions at the center of the transmitted output
. When starting the input bit can be choosen to either output from negative to postive or positive to negative as long as the oppositve bit input has the oppositive output.
Next, if the next input is a 1, then it means that the output has to transition at the start of the bit and of couse it always transitions at the center. If the input bit is zero then there will be no transition at start until it reaches the center.
 

To run the program the user must specify the name of the data file in the first parameter and the code reperesenting the coding scheme in the second parameter. Once
the user has chosen its preferred coding scheme, an ouput file should be created containting the new signal. The signal should be in terms of -V, +V, and 0V. Where "-V" 
represents negative voltage, "+V" positve voltage, and no voltage "0V".
