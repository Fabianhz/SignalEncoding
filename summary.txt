The purpose of this program is to enocode any digital data into digital signals. The coding schemes implemented in this program are: Nonretun to Zero-Level 
(NRZ-L), Nonreturn to Zero Inverted (NRZ-I), Multilevel Binary Bipolar-AMI, Manchester,and Differential Macnhester. 

NRZ-L and NRZ-I are somewhat similar to unipolar NRZ scheme but here we use two levels of amplitude (voltages). For NRZ-L(NRZ-Level), the level of the voltage 
determines the value of the bit, typically binary 1 maps to logic-level high, and binary 0 maps to logic-level low, and for NRZ-I(NRZ-Invert), two-level signal has
a transition at a boundary if the next bit that we are going to transmit is a logical 1, and does not have a transition if the next bit that we are going to transmit
is a logical 0.

Manchester encoding is somewhat combination of the RZ (transition at the middle of the bit) and NRZ-L schemes. The duration of the bit is divided into two halves. 
The voltage remains at one level during the first half and moves to the other level in the second half. The transition at the middle of the bit provides synchronization.
Differential Manchester is somewhat combination of the RZ and NRZ-I schemes. There is always a transition at the middle of the bit but the bit values are determined at
the beginning of the bit. If the next bit is 0, there is a transition, if the next bit is 1, there is no transition.

To run the program the user must specify the name of the data file in the first parameter and the code reperesenting the coding scheme in the second parameter. Once
the user has chosen its preferred coding scheme, an ouput file should be created containting the new signal. The signal should be in terms of -V, +V, and 0V. Where "-V" 
represents negative voltage, "+V" positve voltage, and no voltage "0V".
